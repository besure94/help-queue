## Description

**Note: This is for the `date-fns-lifecycle-methods` branch.**

This application presents users with a home page for a help queue for troubleshooting technical issues. Users can select `Add Ticket`, which takes them to a form where they can submit their names, location, and issue they're experiencing. Selecting `Help!` will submit the ticket to the list on the home page.

A user can select a ticket's details by clicking on it. After doing so, they have the option to update (edit) the ticket, or close (delete) it from the queue.
